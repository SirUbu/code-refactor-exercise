# Code Refactor
This repo contains code that outlines my ability to refactor existing code. The primary objective of this refactor was for web accessibility.

## Files and Directories
The `<Develop>` directory holds the original provided code. This code was cloned from https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram. 


The index.html file and assets directory are copies from the `<Develop>` directory and have been refactored. Feel free to compare the original files to their respective refactored counterparts to get an idea of my ability to refactor code.
